In mainstream media, the term ``security'' is used in a very ambiguous and often misleading way. Because of this, most people do not have a good understanding of what security is, or how it is achieved. For this reason, we suggest that you cover the definition of security pretty early in any trainings tht you do. In this section we definie the traditional CIA of security, and add an additional A for ``authentication,'' which we believe is not covered by the three traditional security principles.  

\subsection{Confidentiality}
The first principle of CyberSecurity is Confidentility.
\subsection{Integrity}
Content has not been modified.
\subsection{Availability}
Content is accessible.
\subsection{Authentication}
